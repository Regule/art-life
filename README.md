# art-life
This is a repository where I store smaller projects related to artificial life.

## Plans

For recent future I plan to
 - First stage
   - Write a script for pillbug trail which is inspired by turtle drawing script using Lindenmayer Systems.
     Pillbug trail will differ in that it will use basic physics for movement.
   - Modify celular system script so that it will have differentiable activation function as well as add
     ability to save grid state and read system configuration from files.
     Also add ability to put more complex structures on grid.
   - Write in Rust a rigid body simulation that will allow me to connect rods and balls and then they will
     act according to laws of physics.

  - Second stage
    - Rewrite cellular system in Rust
    - Rewrite pillbug trail in Rust, this time with more complex physics
